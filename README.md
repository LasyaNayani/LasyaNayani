## Hi there 👋

## 🙋‍♀️ About Me

Hi there! I’m **Lasya Bhatta**, a data enthusiast and recent graduate from the University of Chicago with a Master’s in Applied Data Science. I bring hands-on experience from LTIMindtree and Cognizant, where I worked on large-scale analytics, ETL pipelines, BI dashboards, and data modeling projects. While my professional world revolves around turning data into insights, I’m equally passionate about entrepreneurship and love exploring new ideas that combine creativity with impact. Whether it’s designing smart systems or just experimenting with bold side projects, I’m always building, learning, and dreaming big.
